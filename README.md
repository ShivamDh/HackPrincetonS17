This was a project was create by my team and I at Princeton University's Hackathon, HackPrinceton Spring17, from March 31 to April 2.

The hack/project is a Internet of Things (IoT) for a "smart closet". Through IBM Watson, we created a web based application that allows users to input information regarding clothing items they possess as well as their preferences, and then receive feedback as to what they should wear based on a specific set of criteria (how closely it matches their previous choices, how recently it was worn, specific pairs of clothing that user wore before or preferred, the weather outside (not fully incorporated yet)). The application runs through a website where users input photos of each clothing item, and visual recognition is run on each item and key specs are stored in a database regarding the article of clothing. A user's preferences is gathered by asking for like/dislike on randomized clothing combinations, which are then stored in key-value pairs for later use. Lastly, when needed, the user can ask for an ideal clothing combination to wear that specific day and receive a combination that is bound to be stylish by personal preferences and suitable for the day.

The project tries to expand upon the growing prevalence of internet-connected devices within our everyday world. By incorporating our daily tasks and chores with smart and reliable technology, one hopes to deliver better solutions for problems faced today. Our hack hopes to help users quicken the daily routine of picking out an outfit by having an application do it for you, based on your preferences and what you own.
